# History

1. Started with hello world in python flask forked from https://replit.com/@JamesMorrey/flask-2
   1. Note it would have been better to just start with a blank Python project and add the replit package because that comes with flask.
2. Then try to get it working with bootstrap and the repl.it database
3. example.html is the boilerplate I did not write.  I got this from: github.com/payne/notes which [got it from](https://github.com/payne/notes/commit/2680c33ef785cc724a82461cef7f0fae673cb734)

Bootstrap 4 example added
From https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fontenele/bootstrap-navbar-dropdowns/master/example-bs4.html
which is part of https://github.com/fontenele/bootstrap-navbar-dropdowns
